1. Launch Firefox, head to https://tinder.com/ and log in. You will be taken to the usual feed of swipable profiles.
2. Load this folder as a temporary browser extension.
3. Open the extension context menu (by clicking the puzzle piece icon in the top right). This is the UI that you will use to scrape the profiles.
4. While on the logged-in Tinder tab, click "init" in the UI.
5. The extension will prompt you for various metadata about your Tinder feed settings. Follow the dialogue instructions.
6. The extension will scrape the current profile. You call tell this is happening, since it automatically scrolls through all the pictures (which is nessecary to download them, for HTML reasons).
7. When the pictures stop scrolling and/or when the buttons in the UI is enabled, the profile is scraped and ready for your swipe. You may now scroll the pictures manually if you want to.
8. Click the button in the UI corresponding to your desired swipe. (DO NOT click the Tinder page's own swipe buttons, nor use hotkeys.) The extension will automatically perform the swipe, and then save the metadata.
9. Jump back to step 6 to scrape and swipe the next profile. Repeat as many times as you want.
10. When done swiping for now, simply close the browser.
